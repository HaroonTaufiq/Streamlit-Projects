# Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image Models

This project contains two Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating the use of public models for image-to-text and text-to-image tasks. The models used are `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` for image-to-text and `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` for text-to-image.

## Notebooks

1. **Image-to-Text Model**: Uses the `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` model to generate captions for images.
2. **Text-to-Image Model**: Uses the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` model to generate images from text descriptions.
